# odin-recepies
1st project for The Odin Project!
My assignment is to build a recipie website using the knowledge I've gained about HTML up to this point.

NOTES:
- no CSS yet
- I have to remember to push to github more often during the process

What I learned:
- committing early is really a big deal. I just went through a mess of merging teh remote and local repos after making the mistake of editing in the github repo itself, instead of editing locally and then staging and committing my changes. Felt like the harder way to do it, and i'll avoid that in future.
- got good practice with staging and commiting changes.
